File globs are a very concise way to specify a large
number of files. You may give multiple file globs
separated by commas. To learn more about glob patterns
please visit: {}

For example, you may want to include your src/ folder and
all its contents but exclude your .git directory and all
.o files. To do this, simply give `src/` for the first
question and `.git/**,**/*.o` for the second question.
